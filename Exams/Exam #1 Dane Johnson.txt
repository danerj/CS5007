Part 2: Code Review (20 Marks)
-------------------------------------------


Is there anything wrong with the following code? If yes, what is the problem? If no, why?




>>> def fun(s):
        print (s[0])
        if len(s) == 0:
                return
        fun (s[1:len(s)])

I assume that we intend s to be a list. The first problem is that there is no description explaining what the intended
output of the program should be so it makes the program difficult to debug. However, it might be that the program is supposed
to print out each element of a list in order one at a time. As written the program always throws an error because

	(a) If s is empty, s[0] refers to a nonexistent first element of s.
	(b) If s is not empty, we recursively call fun on a list of length one less than s, which will eventually lead to fun
		being called on an empty list and producing the error described in (a).
		
To fix the program, we could move the 'if' statement to before the print statement. Then if an empty list s is passed into fun,
the function will just return the None object and terminate without trying to print the nonexistent s[0] (and thereby avoid an
indexing error). Otherwise if s is not empty the function passes by the 'if' statement, prints s[0] and then moves onto a list
of length one less than s. Also the return statement has been indented twice into the body of the 'if' statement so we should
remove one indentation:

# Fixed version of fun
def fun(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return
	print (s[0])
    fun (s[1:len(s)])

This version of the program prints out each element of a list s if s is nonempty or does not print anything if s is empty.
Note that no matter whether s is empty of not, this fixed version of fun still returns None. That is, calling fun(s) will
print out the elements of s (if any) while calling print(fun(s)) will print out 'None' to the terminal.

Part 3: Iterative Function (25 Marks)
-------------------------------------------------


Given a list L1, write a Python function func1 that returns the reverse of L1 as follows


>>> L1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> L2 = func1(L1)
>>> print (L2)
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]




Note that func1 must be coded as an *iterative function*.


######## ADD YOUR CODE OF FUNC1 HERE ########

def func1(L1):
    L2 = []
    for i in range(len(L1)-1,-1,-1):
        L2.append(L1[i])
    return L2

---------------------------------------------------
Part 4: Recursive Function (25 Marks)
---------------------------------------------------


Given a list L1, write a Python function func2 that returns the reverse of L1 as follows


>>> L1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> L2 = func2(L1)
>>> print (L2)
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


Note that func2 must be coded as a *recursive function*.

def func2(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst
    else:
        return [lst[-1]] + func2(lst[:len(lst)-1])
