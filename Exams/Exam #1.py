Part 2: Code Review (20 Marks)
-------------------------------------------


Is there anything wrong with the following code? If yes, what is the problem? If no, why?




>>> def fun(s):
        print (s[0])
        if len(s) == 0:
                return
        fun (s[1:len(s)])

Part 3: Iterative Function (25 Marks)
-------------------------------------------------


Given a list L1, write a Python function func1 that returns the reverse of L1 as follows


>>> L1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> L2 = func1(L1)
>>> print (L2)
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]




Note that func1 must be coded as an *iterative function*.

Part 4: Recursive Function (25 Marks)
---------------------------------------------------


Given a list L1, write a Python function func2 that returns the reverse of L1 as follows


>>> L1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> L2 = func2(L1)
>>> print (L2)
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


Note that func2 must be coded as a *recursive function*.
